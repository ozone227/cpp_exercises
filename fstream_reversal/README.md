# File Operations & Reverse Iterators

*Exercise:*
Create a C++ program that will obtain input from a user and store it into a source.txt file. The program must append it to the provided text file, without deleting any existing data. Create a reversal method that will reverse all of the characters in the *source.txt* file and store the result in a destination.txt file.
