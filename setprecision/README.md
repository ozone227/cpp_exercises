# Using Setprecision & Fixed to Format Currency


* Use std::setprecision & std::fixed to properly format a double as currency.
* **std::setprecision**: Sets the decimal precision to be used to format floating-point values on output operations.
* **std::fixed**: When floatfield is set to fixed, floating-point values are written using fixed-point notation: the value is represented with exactly as many digits in the decimal part as specified by the precision field (precision) and with no exponent part.
