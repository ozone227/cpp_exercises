# Integer Pointers Program and Analysis

* Create a C++ program that asks the user to enter three integer values as input.

* Store the values into three different variables.

* For each variable, create three integer pointers that point to each value.

* Display the contents of the variables and pointers. In your program, be sure to use the new operator and delete operators to management memory.
